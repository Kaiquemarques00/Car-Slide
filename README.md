<h2 align="center">Description</h2>

<p align="left">
  A single page application, using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JS to complete some actions/events.
  This project was started with the aim of exercising and improving my skills with animations and manipulating the state of a page. It was completed and had a good aggregation for the objective for which it was started.
  As for other elements, they were basically a basic structure of a web page.
